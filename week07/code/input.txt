miusov as a man man of breeding and deilcacy could not but feel some inwrd qualms when he reached the father superiors with ivan he felt ashamed of havin lost his temper he felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch fyodor pavlovitch too much to have been upset by him in father zossimas cell and so to have forgotten himself teh monks were not to blame in any case he reflceted on the steps and if theyre decent people here and the father superior i understand is a nobleman why not be friendly and courteous withthem i wont argue ill fall in with everything ill win them by politness and show them that ive nothing to do with that aesop thta buffoon that pierrot and have merely been takken in over this affair just as they have

he determined to drop his litigation with the monastry and relinguish his claims to the woodcuting and fishery rihgts at once he was the more ready to do this becuase the rights had becom much less valuable and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were

these excellant intentions were strengthed when he enterd the father superiors diniingroom though stricttly speakin it was not a diningroom for the father superior had only two rooms alltogether; they were however much larger and more comfortable than father zossimas but tehre was was no great luxury about the furnishng of these rooms eithar the furniture was of mohogany covered with leather in the oldfashionned style of  the floor was not even stained but evreything was shining with cleanlyness and there were many chioce flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was of course the beatifuly decorated table the cloth was clean the service shone; there were three kinds of wellbaked bread two bottles of wine two of excellent mead and a large glass jug of kvas  both the latter made in the monastery and famous in the neigborhood there was no vodka rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes fishsuop made of sterlets served with little fish paties; then boiled fish served in a spesial way; then salmon cutlets ice pudding and compote and finally blancmange rakitin found out about all these good things for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen where he already had a footing he had a footting everywhere and got informaiton about everything he was of an uneasy and envious temper he was well aware of his own considerable abilities and nervously exaggerated them in his selfconceit he knew he would play a prominant part of some sort but alyosha who was attached to him was distressed to see that his friend rakitin was dishonorble and quite unconscios of being so himself considering on the contrary that because he would not steal moneey left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity neither alyosha nor anyone else could have infleunced him in that

rakitin of course was a person of tooo little consecuense to be invited to the dinner to which father iosif father paissy and one othr monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited they were alraedy waiting when miusov kalganov and ivan arrived the other guest maximov stood a little aside waiting also the father superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests he was a tall thin but still vigorous old man with black hair streakd with grey and a long grave ascetic face he bowed to his guests in silence but this time they approaced to receive his blessing miusov even tried to kiss his hand but the father superior drew it back in time to aboid the salute but ivan and kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simplehearted and complete manner kissing his hand as peesants do

we must apologize most humbly your reverance began miusov simpering affably and speakin in a dignified and respecful tone pardonus for having come alone without the genttleman you invited fyodor pavlovitch he felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitalty and not wihtout reason in the reverand father zossimas cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissention with his son and let fall words which were quite out of keeping in fact quite unseamly as  he glanced at the monks  your reverance is no doubt already aware and therefore recognising that he had been to blame he felt sincere regret and shame and begged me and his son ivan fyodorovitch to convey to you his apologees and regrets in brief he hopes and desires to make amends later he asks your blessinq and begs you to forget what has takn place

as he utterred the last word of his terade miusov completely recovered his selfcomplecency and all traces of his former iritation disappaered he fuly and sincerelly loved humanity again

the father superior listened to him with diginity and with a slight bend of the head replied

i sincerly deplore his absence perhaps at our table he might have learnt to like us and we him pray be seated gentlemen

he stood before the holly image and began to say grace aloud all bent their heads reverently and maximov clasped his hands before him with peculier fervor

it was at this moment that fyodor pavlovitch played his last prank it must be noted that he realy had meant to go home and really had felt the imposibility of going to dine with the father superior as though nothing had happenned after his disgraceful behavoir in the elders cell not that he was so very much ashamed of himself  quite the contrary perhaps but still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner yet hiscreaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel and he had hardly got into it when he sudddenly stoped short he remembered his own words at the elders i always feel when i meet people that i am lower than all and that they all take me for a buffon; so i say let me play the buffoon for you are every one of you stupider and lower than i he longed to revenge himself on everone for his own unseemliness he suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked why do you hate so and so so much and he had answered them with his shaemless impudence ill tell you he has done me no harm but i played him a dirty trick and ever since i have hated him

rememebering that now he smiled quietly and malignently hesitating for a moment his eyes gleamed and his lips positively quivered

well since i have begun i may as well go on he decided his predominant sensation at that moment might be expresed in the folowing words well there is no rehabilitating myself now so let me shame them for all i am worht i will show them i dont care what they think  thats all

he told the caochman to wait while with rapid steps he returnd to the monastery and staight to the father superiors he had no clear idea what he would do but he knew that he could not control himself and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obsenity but only to obsenity to nothing criminal nothing for which he couldbe legally punished in the last resort he could always restrain himself and had marvelled indeed at himself on that score sometimes he appeered in the father superiors diningroom at the moment when the prayer was over and all were moving to the table standing in the doorway he scanned the company and laughing his prolonged impudent malicius chuckle looked them all boldly in the face they thought i had gone and here i am again he cried to the wholle room

for one moment everyone stared at him withot a word; and at once everyone felt that someting revolting grotescue positively scandalous was about to happen miusov passed immeditaely from the most benevolen frame of mind to the most savage all the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly

no this i cannot endure he cried i absolutly cannot and i certainly cannot

the blood rushed to his head he positively stammered; but he was beyyond thinking of style and he seized his hat

what is it he cannot cried fyodor pavlovitch that he absolutely cannot and certanly cannot your reverence am i to come in or not will you recieve me as your guest

you are welcome with all my heart answerred the superior gentlemen he added i venture to beg you most earnesly to lay aside your dissentions and to be united in love and family harmoni with prayer to the lord at our humble table

no no it is impossible cryed miusov beside himself

well if it is impossible for pyotr alexandrovitch it is impossible for me and i wont stop that is why i came i will keep with pyotr alexandrovitch everywere now if you will go away pyotr alexandrovitch i will go away too if you remain i will remain you stung him by what you said about family harmony father superior he does not admit he is my realtion thats right isnt it von sohn heres von sohn how are you von sohn

do you mean me mutered maximov puzzled

of course i mean you cried fyodor pavlovitch who else the father superior cuold not be von sohn

but i am not von sohn either i am maximov

no you are von sohn your reverence do you know who von sohn was it was a famos murder case he was killed in a house of harlotry  i believe that is what such places are called among you he was killed and robed and in spite of his venarable age he was nailed up in a box and sent from petersburg to moscow in the lugage van and while they were nailling him up the harlots sang songs and played the harp that is to say the piano so this is that very von solin he has risen from the dead hasnt he von sohn

what is happening whats this voices were heard in the groop of monks

let us go cried miusov addresing kalganov

no excuse me fyodor pavlovitch broke in shrilly taking another stepinto the room allow me to finis there in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfuly just because i spoke of eating gudgeon pyotr alexandrovitch miusov my relation prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincerite in his words but i prefer in mine plus de sincerite que de noblesse and  damn the noblesse thats right isnt it von sohn allow me father superior though i am a buffoon and play the buffoon yet i am the soul of honor and i want to speak my mind yes i am teh soul of honour while in pyotr alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else i came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind my son alexey is here being saved i am his father; i care for his welfare and it is my duty to care while ive been playing the fool i have been listening and havig a look on the sly; and now i want to give you the last act of the performence you know how things are with us as a thing falls so it lies as a thing once has falen so it must lie for ever not a bit of it i want to get up again holy father i am indignent with you confession is a great sacrament before which i am ready to bow down reverently; but there in the cell they all kneal down and confess aloud can it be right to confess aloud it was ordained by the holy fathers to confess in sercet then only your confession will be a mystery and so it was of old but how can i explain to him before everyone that i did this and that well you understand what  sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it  so it is really a scandal no fathers one might be carried along with you to the flagellants i dare say att the first opportunity i shall write to the synod and i shall take my son alexey home

we must note here that fyodor pavlovitch knew whree to look for the weak spot there had been at one time malicius rumors which had even reached the archbishop not only regarding our monastery but in others where the instutition of elders existed that too much respect was paid to the elders even to the detrement of the auhtority of the superior that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on  absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere but the spirit of folly which had caught up fyodor pavlovitch and was bearring him on the curent of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy prompted him with this old slander fyodor pavlovitch did not understand a word of it and he could not even put it sensibly for on this occasion no one had been kneelling and confesing aloud in the elders cell so that he could not have seen anything of the kind he was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders but as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense and at once longed to prove to his audiance and above all to himself that he had not been talking nonsense and though he knew perfectily well that with each word he would be adding morre and more absurdity he could not restrian himself and plunged forward blindly

how disgraveful cried pyotr alexandrovitch

pardon me said the father superior it was said of old many have begun to speak agains me and have uttered evil sayings about me and hearing it i have said to myself it is the correcsion of the lord and he has sent it to heal my vain soul and so we humbely thank you honored geust and he made fyodor pavlovitch a low bow

tut  tut  tut  sanctimoniuosness and stock phrases old phrasses and old gestures the old lies and formal prostratoins we know all about them a kisss on the lips and a dagger in the heart as in schillers robbers i dont like falsehood fathers i want the truth but the trut is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that i proclam aloud father monks why do you fast why do you expect reward in heaven for that why for reward like that i will come and fast too no saintly monk you try being vittuous in the world do good to society without shuting yourself up in a monastery at other peoples expense and without expecting a reward up aloft for it  youll find taht a bit harder i can talk sense too father superior what have they got here he went up to the table old port wine mead brewed by the eliseyev brothers fie fie fathers that is something beyond gudgeon look at the bottles the fathers have brought out he he he and who has provided it all the russian peasant the laborer brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand wringing it from his family and the taxgaterer you bleed the people you know holy fathers

this is too disgraceful said father iosif

father paissy kept obsinately silent miusov rushed from the room and kalgonov afetr him

well father i will follow pyotr alexandrovitch i am not coming to see you again you may beg me on your knees i shant come i sent you a thousand roubles so you have begun to keep your eye on me he he he no ill say no more i am taking my revenge for my youth for all the humillition i endured he thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feelling this monastery has played a great part in my life it has cost me many bitter tears you used to set my wife the crazy one against me you cursed me with bell and book you spread stories about me all over the place enough fathers this is the age of liberalizm the age of steamers and reilways neither a thousand nor a hundred ruobles no nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me

it must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his liffe and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it but he was so carried away by his simulated emotion that he was for one momant allmost beliefing it himself he was so touched he was almost weeping but at that very instant he felt that it was time to draw back

the father superior bowed his head at his malicious lie and again spoke impressively

it is writen again bear circumspecly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee and so will we

tut tut tut bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole bethink yourselfs fathers i will go but i will take my son alexey away from here for ever on my parental authority ivan fyodorovitch my most dutiful son permit me to order you to follow me von sohn what have you to stay for come and see me now in the town it is fun there it is only one short verst; instead of lenten oil i will give you suckingpig and kasha we will have dinner with some brendy and liqueur to it ive cloudberry wyne hey von sohn dont lose your chance he went out shuoting and gesticulating

it was at that moment rakitin saw him and pointed him out to alyosha

alexey his father shouted from far off cacthing sight of him you come home to me today for good and bring your pilow and matress and leeve no trace behind

alyosha stood rooted to the spot wacthing the scene in silense meanwhile fyodor pavlovitch had got into the carriege and ivan was about to follow him in grim silance without even turnin to say goodbye to alyosha but at this point another allmost incrediple scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishng touch to the episode maximov suddenly appeered by the side of the carriage he ran up panting afraid of being too late rakitin and alyosha saw him runing he was in such a hurry that in his impatiense he put his foot on the step on which ivans left foot was still resting and clucthing the carriage he kept tryng to jump in i am going with you  he kept shouting laughing a thin mirthfull laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face take me too

there cried fyodor pavlovitch delihted did i not say he waz von sohn it iz von sohn himself risen from the dead why how did you tear yourself away what did you von sohn there and how could you get away from the dinner you must be a brazenfaced fellow i am that myself but i am surprized at you brother jump in jump in let him pass ivan it will be fun he can lie somwhere at our feet will you lie at our feet von sohn or perch on the box with the coachman skipp on to the box von sohn

but ivan who had by now taken his seat without a word gave maximov a voilent punch in the breast and sent him flying it was quite by chanse he did not fall

drive on ivan shouted angryly to the coachman

why what are you doing what are you abuot why did you do that fyodor pavlovitch protested

but the cariage had already driven away ivan made no reply

well you are a fellow fyodor pavlovitch siad again

after a pouse of two minutes looking askance at his son why it was you got up all this monastery busines you urged it you approvved of it why are you angry now

youve talked rot enough you might rest a bit now ivan snaped sullenly

fyodor pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes

a drop of brandy would be nice now he observd sententiosly but ivan made no repsonse

you shall have some too when we get home

ivan was still silent

fyodor pavlovitch waited anohter two minites

but i shall take alyosha away from the monastery though you will dislike it so much most honored karl von moor

ivan shruged his shuolders contemptuosly and turning away stared at the road and they did not speek again all the way home
